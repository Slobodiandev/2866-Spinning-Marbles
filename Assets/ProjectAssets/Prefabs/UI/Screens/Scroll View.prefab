  m_text: "These terms and conditions apply to the Spinning Marbles app (hereby referred
    to as \"Application\") for mobile devices that was created by Avne Blif (hereby
    referred to as \"Service Provider\") as an Open Source service.\n\n \nUpon downloading
    or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following
    terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms
    prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application,
    any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts
    to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into
    other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks,
    copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to
    the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.\n\n \nThe Service
    Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient
    as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge
    for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures
    you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated
    to you.\n\n \nThe Application stores and processes personal data that you have
    provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your
    responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application.
    The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone,
    which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
    official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone
    to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features,
    and may result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.\n\n \nPlease
    be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain
    aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection,
    which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider
    cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity
    due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.\n\n
    \nIf you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that
    your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you
    may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection
    to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you
    accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if
    you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country)
    without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device
    on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission
    from the bill payer.\n\n \nSimilarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume
    responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility
    to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery
    and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held
    responsible.\n\n \nIn terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your
    use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure
    that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
    provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service
    Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience
    as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.\n\n
    \nThe Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The
    application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating
    system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability
    of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates
    if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not
    guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to
    you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed
    on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application
    when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the
    application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination
    notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
    rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease
    using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.\n\nChanges
    to These Terms and Conditions\nThe Service Provider may periodically update their
    Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly
    for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting
    the new Terms and Conditions on this page.\n\n \nThese terms and conditions are
    effective as of 2025-05-08\n\nContact Us\nIf you have any questions or suggestions
    about the Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to contact the Service
    Provider at slobodiantamara@gmail.com.\n"
